Create an application for different operations with collections.

<b>First screen</b>: operations with array.

Generate an array of integers with 10_000_000 elements from 0 to 9_999_999 and display the execution time.

Operations to perform:

- insert at the beginning of an array 1000 elements (from 0 to 999 for example) one-by-one / at once;
- insert in the middle of an array 1000 elements one-by-one / at once;
- append to the end of an array 1000 elements one-by-one / at once;
- remove at the beginning 1000 elements one-by-one / at once;
- remove in the middle 1000 elements one-by-one / at once;
- remove at the end 1000 elements one-by-one / at once.
	Display the execution time of each operation.

	Add an activity indicator for each long-running operation.
